            <h2>What is Safeguarding?</h2>
            <p>Creating a safe and welcoming environment, where everyone is respected and valued, is at the heart of
                safeguarding.</p>
            <p>It's about making sure your organisation is run in a way that actively prevents harm, harassment,
                bullying,
                abuse and neglect. It's also about being ready to respond safely and well if there is a problem.</p>
            <p>Everyone in the organisation has a role to play in safeguarding. It should become part of your day to day
                activities.</p>
            <p>Every organisation that delivers charitable activities has a duty to safeguard volunteers, staff members,
                participants and donors.</p>

                    <h3>Recognise</h3>
                    <p>Recognising that the person is vulnerable and then spotting the signs of abuse is often the first
                        step in safeguarding adults and children effectively. This step sets the stage for taking
                        further action in safeguarding adults and children. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Respond</h3>
                    <p>Responding in an appropriate manner is vital, as this ensures that the situation is acknowledged
                        and addressed promptly, preventing further harm.
                        Handle the situation calmly with great care and caution, as some people may not be willing to
                        talk about their situation.
                        Ask open questions to encourage a response</p>

                        The designated person or team will then take responsibility for dealing with the matter
                        professionally.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Record</h3>
                    <p>Record an incident as soon as possible.
                        Record an incident in the best detail, including who is involved, dates and times.
                        Take precise and comprehensive notes of the situation to assist in your report and relay these
                        where necessary.
                        In the notes, use the who, what, why, when and where of safeguarding.
                        Keeping detailed records ensures there is an accurate account of what happened, which can be
                        invaluable during an investigation.</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Refer</h3>

                        potential harm to the individual.
                        If you believe the safeguarding risk to be more urgent, such as a suspicion that somebody is
                        under immediate or severe threat, you should contact the relevant authority immediately, whether
                        this is the police, fire service or ambulance crew.
