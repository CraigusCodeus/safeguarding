            <h2>What is safeguarding?</h2>
            <p>Creating a safe and welcoming environment, where everyone is respected and valued, is at the heart of
                safeguarding.</p>
            <p>It’s about making sure your organisation is run in a way that actively prevents harm, harassment,
                bullying, abuse, neglect and exploitation.</p>
            <p>It’s also about implementing policies, training, and procedures to prevent harm and being ready to
                respond safely and effectively I f there is a problem.</p>
            <p>Everyone in the organisation has a role to play in safeguarding. It should become part of your day to day
                activities.</p>
            <p>Every organisation that delivers charitable activities has a duty to safeguard volunteers, staff members,
                participants and donors.</p>
